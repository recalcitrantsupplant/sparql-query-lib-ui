# Code Review Summary - Top 3 Areas for Attention

This document outlines the top three areas identified during a codebase review that warrant further investigation for potential unused code, design issues, or incomplete features.

## 1. Query Group Feature Implementation & TODOs

**Observation:**
A significant number of `TODO` comments exist within components related to the Query Group feature, including:
*   `QueryGroupCanvas.vue`
*   `QueryGroupList.vue`
*   `QueryGroupView.vue`

These TODOs concern core functionalities such as:
*   Edge creation and management in the canvas.
*   Query node management.
*   Data fetching and selection logic for query group lists.
*   UI state handling (e.g., behavior when no group is selected, resetting canvas state).

**Potential Issues:**
*   Incomplete implementation of planned features (as suggested by `docs/QueryGroupFeaturePlan.md` and `docs/QueryGroupCanvasStatePersistence.md`).
*   Gaps in user experience or functionality, particularly if `QueryGroupList.vue` lacks critical fetching/selection capabilities.

**Recommendation:**
Review the outstanding TODOs in these components. Prioritize implementing missing core functionalities and refining existing ones to ensure the Query Group feature is robust and complete.

## 2. Confirmed Orphaned Component: `QueryGroupDetailsEditor.vue`

**Observation:**
Through code analysis and verification, the component `components/QueryGroupDetailsEditor.vue` has been identified as orphaned. It was imported in `pages/queries.vue` but was not used in the template, and its import was removed from `components/QueryGroupActionButtons.vue`. This indicates it was likely superseded by `UnifiedDetailsEditor.vue` during a refactoring.

**Action Taken:**
The orphaned file `components/QueryGroupDetailsEditor.vue` has been deleted, and the leftover import in `pages/queries.vue` has been removed.

## 3. Admin Page (`pages/admin.vue`) Functionality & Completeness

**Observation:**
*   The `pages/admin.vue` file contains a prominent `TODO`: "Add Create/Edit/Delete Backend forms/modals".
*   This page utilizes the `useExecutionBackendsApi` composable, which includes functions for `createBackend`, `updateBackend`, and `deleteBackend`.

**Potential Issues:**
*   The admin functionality for managing execution backends appears to be incomplete, as the UI for these core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations is missing.
*   This means a significant portion of the `useExecutionBackendsApi` composable's capabilities might not be currently exposed or usable through the UI.

**Recommendation:**
Assess the current priority and roadmap for the admin page features.
*   If this functionality is important, prioritize the implementation of the missing forms/modals.
*   If this feature has been deprioritized, consider whether the existing `admin.vue` page and parts of `useExecutionBackendsApi` constitute dead or orphaned code that could be simplified or removed.
